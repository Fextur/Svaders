# Svaders
My first programming project - space invaders in assembly

# How to run the project
Open DOSBOX, mount this folder and just call SVADERS.EXE

# How to compile the project
After mounting this folder run the following command:
tasm Svaders.asm
tlink svaders.obj
After that the SVADERS.EXE file should be newly compiled
